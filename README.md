# gpt-docstring
Precommit hook to generate docstrings for functions that are missing them. Uses GPT 3.5.


## Setup


## TODO
The hook repository must be installable via pip install . (usually by either setup.py or pyproject.toml). The installed package will provide an executable that will match the entry â€“ usually through console_scripts or scripts in setup.py.

Support: python hooks work without any system-level dependencies. It has been tested on linux, macOS, windows, and cygwin.
